2007-12-22 Version 0.502

	* Revised the build process to be more Linux-neutral, and other
	  minor things.
	  patch.pl: Create a .bak backup file before making changes
	  to patch files.
	  Makefile: Insert python-config options directly, rather than
	  inserting backticks into the makefile.
	  Makefile: Don't use echo -e, since -e seems not to be universal.
	  Makefile: Don't patch sendpraat since we don't need it, and if
	  it's already been patched, we print a spurrious warning.

2007-11-28 Version 0.501

	* Changed the behavior of the selection functions
	  and added plus and minus.
